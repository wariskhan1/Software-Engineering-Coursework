# Defining the use case diagram
In this page we will be  defining full use cases for our system

## What is a use case diagram?

* A use case diagram is used in software engineering projects so that we can clearly see all the interactions a user can have with the system

* A use case diagram can also be used to summarize the information of a system and also the information generated from the users which is done when they have used the system 

* It is a great way of easily projecting ideas and planning which is useful later on during project development

*  Use case diagrams only only includes some of the relationships between use cases, actors, and systems. No order is shown such as 

* Software Engineers constantly communicate with Client for understand the utility and requirements of the system, practically in real time.

* User does NOT have relationship with Software Engineers team neither direct relationship with Client.
