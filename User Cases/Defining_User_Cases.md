# Defining the use case diagram
In this page we will be  defining full use cases for our system

## What is a use case diagram?

* A use case diagram is used in software engineering projects so that we can clearly see all the interactions a user can have with the system

* A use case diagram can also be used to summarize the information of a system and also the information generated from the users which is done when they have used the system 

* It is a great way of easily projecting ideas and planning which is useful later on during project development

*  Use case diagram only includes some of the relationships between use cases, actors, and systems. No order is shown such as 

* Software Engineers constantly communicate with Client to understand the utility and requirements of the system, practically in real-time.

* User does NOT have a relationship with Software Engineers team neither direct relationship with Client.

* A use case is a descreption of how someone who uses a process or system will achieve a goal.

* It's most commonly linked with software systems, although it may be used in any process.

* Use case diagram resembles the overall activity in the system and what roles are played in the system.

* A use case diagram is a graphic depiction of the interactions among the elements of a system.

* A use case is a primary form of system/software requirements for a new software program under developed. Use cases specify the expected behaviour and not the exact method of making it happen.

* A key concept of use case modelling is that it helps us design a system from the end user's perspective.

* It is an effective technique for communicating system behaviour in the user's terms by specifying all externally visible system behaviour.

* Use case diagrams are used to gather the requirements of a system including internal and external influences.

* The purpose of the use case diagram is to capture the dynamic aspect of a system.
* A use case diagram can help in providing a higher level vew of the system hence we can say that it is a blue print of the system.
* A use case diagram can used for
  1- requirments analysis and high level design.
  2- reverse engineering
  3- forward engineering.
