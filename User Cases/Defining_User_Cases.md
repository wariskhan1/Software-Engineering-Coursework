# Defining the use case diagram
In this page we will be  defining full use cases for our system

## What is a use case diagram?

* A use case diagram is used in software engineering projects so that we can clearly see all the interactions a user can have with the system

* A use case diagram can also be used to summarize the information of a system and also the information generated from the users which is done when they have used the system 

* It is a great way of easily projecting ideas and planning which is useful later on during project development

*  Use case diagrams only only includes some of the relationships between use cases, actors, and systems. No order is shown such as 

* Software Engineers constantly communicate with Client for understand the utility and requirements of the system, practically in real time.

* User does NOT have relationship with Software Engineers team neither direct relationship with Client.

* A use case is a descreption of how someone who uses a process or system will achieve a goal.
* it`s most commonly linked with software systems, although it may be used to any process.
* use case diagram resembles the overall activity in the system and what roles are played in the system.
* A use case diagram is graphic depiction of the interactions among the elements of a system .
* A use case is the primary form of system/software requiremnets for a new software program under developed. Use cases specify the expected behaviour, and not the exact the method of making it happen.
* A key concept of use case modeling is that it helps us design a system from end user`s perspective.
* it is an effective technique  for communicating system behaviour in the user`s terms by specifying all externally visible system behavior.
* Use case diagranes are used to gather the requirments of a system including internal and external influences. 
* The purpose of use case diagram is to capture the dynamic aspect of a system is t ocapture the dynmaic aspect of a system.
